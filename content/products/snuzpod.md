Made from high-quality beech wood, and available in an array of versatile colours to match your decor or room theme. These cribs features see-through mesh window which aids breathability and allows you to feel reassured without risking disturbing baby's sleep. The unique zip-down side wall means you can comfort and feed your baby, before returning back up to provide them with a safe and secure space, out of the way of any loose duvets or bedding. The SnuzPod cribs are height adjustable, so you can match the SnüzPod mattress base height to the mattress in your bed

Every SnüzPod has undergone extensive product testing, and has been tested to, and passed British Standards BS EN 1130 (cribs and cradles), and is the only bedside crib to pass BS EN 1466 (moses baskets).
